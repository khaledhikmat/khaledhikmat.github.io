<p>
Father of six and an old time software technologist and architect. I live in Sharjah, the United Arab Emirates. I work for an international company (headquartered in the US and deals with hotel management and marketing) as Chief Technology Officer i.e. CTO. I have been with this company for 12 years and I really love my job.

<p>
My recent technology interest has been Android and Windows Phone development, Web APIs and Windows Azure. In my long career, I started with Motorola 68000 and Z8000 assembly languages, then C, then C++, then Java, then C#, JavaScript and Node.

In my blog posts, I will touch mainly on three different categories: Technical, Health and Arabic. Although I occasionally write in my companyâ€™s internal blogs and keep many notes in my Office OneNote, I have never  written publicly! This blog site is my first attempt to change that and try to merge with the rest of the world by sharing some of my personal and technical experiences.
