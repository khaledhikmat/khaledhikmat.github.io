We have most of our source code and documentation on GitHub. They are in private repositories though. I have always wanted to share repository information with our company executives. The following will be nice:

* Who is doing what and when to the source code repositories
* List of our source code and documentation repositories, status, last update, etc

I wanted to provide this on a browser link available publicly.
