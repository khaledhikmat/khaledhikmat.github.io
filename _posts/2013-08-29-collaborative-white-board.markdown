I created a little sample to learn SignalR! This Collaborative White Board sample is obviously not an earth-shattering invention nor is it a demonstration of great code writing. It is simply a way to learn SignalR.

The idea is simple and widely availableâ€¦allow people to collaborate using a white board canvas on their browsers or alternatively other client such as a console app, Windows 8 or Windows Phone. The board supports drawing and text. The sample is hosted here for a little while. It shows JavaScript and .NET clients connecting to the hub.

Technologies Involved:

* ASP .NET 4.5
* ASP .NET SignalR
* HTML5 and the canvas APIs
* jQuery

To start with SignalR, please checkout the [Getting Started with SignalR](http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr) tutorial on the ASP.NET site.

The source code for the White Board is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/khaledHikmat/CollaborativeWhiteBoard).

Thanks.
