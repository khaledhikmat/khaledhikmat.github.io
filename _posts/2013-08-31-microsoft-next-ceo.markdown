Unless you have been in a cave, you must have heard that Microsoft's Steve Ballmer has decided to step down and allow someone else to run the computer giant. Here is what he had to say:

“We have embarked on a new strategy with a new organization and we have an amazing Senior Leadership Team. My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our company’s transformation to a devices and services company. We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.”

There are many articles that praise Mr. Ballmer's departure and consider him a failure:

But there is at least one article that presents Mr. Ballmer in a different perspective and offers an unbiased yet critical analysis. I really like this article and recommend it as great reading:

Here is a link that shows who is lined up for the new job (Mr. Scott Hanselman and Mr. Scott Guthrie are my favorite candidates... they are both truly awesome):

My 2 cents.... I have been a Java guy for a long time! About 18 months ago (April 2012), I decided to re-examine Microsoft's offerings after a very successful experience with their SQL Server 2008 Business Intelligence stack (Integration, Analysis and Reporting services). I looked at Microsoft's s Web Technologies (ASP .NET MVC, Web API and SignalR), Client technologies (including Mobile W8 and WP8) and Cloud Technologies. I really like what I see! I think Microsoft has come a long way as I felt there was an ideological shift in Microsoft's thinking ... it seems to be more humble and more innovative.

Regarding Microsoft's Windows Phone, I really think it is a great platform....at least from a developer's perspective. In my opinion, the reason WP8 does not have as many apps is simply because Microsoft's developers are largely enterprise developers whereas the Android folks are more like start-ups and enthusiasts. So it is a matter of culture as opposed to weakness in the platform. BTW...I am now working on both Android and WP8 and hopefully I will write up something about my experience  using those two platforms.

Regarding the CEO candidates, I have been exposed (via their articles, blogs and tweets) to Mr. Scott Hansleman and Mr. Scott Guthrie as they are both in the developer division. Both seem to have leadership qualities that will allow them to take Microsoft to a new level  should one of them become the new CEO.
