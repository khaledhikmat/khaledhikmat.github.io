The POS Agent is a piece of software that communicates directly with the POS Terminal. It is installed on the hotel's premises and communicates with 
the POS terminals over TCP/IP. The initial version of the agent supports two types of commands:

    *   Voucher Validations
    *   Voucher Trackings

In order to

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably
-- as list markers:

    *   Red
    *   Green
    *   Blue

is equivalent to:

    +   Red
    +   Green
    +   Blue

and:

    -   Red
    -   Green
    -   Blue

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

    1.  Bird
    2.  McHale
    3.  Parish
