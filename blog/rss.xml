            <description><![CDATA[I wanted to assess Azure Cosmos DB to see possibilities of converting some of our backend applications to use this database technology to provide a globally distributed database that we desperately need as our services now cover a bigger geographic location. However, this post is not about Cosmos DB specifically! It is mainly about notes about the architecture of the pieces that surround Cosmos and how I am thinking to implement them.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If a Web App is deployed on Azure, both the App Insights and Web Apps offer a utility that can hammer the app's endpoints from different regions. While this functionality is quite nice and comes bundled in, it is considered an alert-based system and is slightly rudimentary as one cannot customize the test or get access to the full results easily. This post describes an alternative approach that uses Azure Functions or Service Fabric to implement a web test that can test and endpoint and report its test to PowerBI in real time.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I am new to Xamarin development and I also wanted to try the newly announced VS for mac! So I created a little Camera app that can be used to evaluate presentations. The app allows the user to take a selfie. When committed, the picture is sent to an Azure cognitive function to extract the gender, male and smile (a measure of emotion). The app then displays the taken picture and returned result in the app. It also sends the result to PowerBI real-time stream to allow the visualization of the evaluation results.]]></description>

The problem is that if I change the Web API to a token-based, all existing mobile apps in the field will not function as they will be refused Web API connection.]]></description>
